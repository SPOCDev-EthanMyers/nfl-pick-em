# Weekly Summary Dashboard Guide

## Overview

The Weekly Summary Dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of all games in a week, intelligently categorizing them based on data confidence and outcomes. This helps you quickly identify:

- **For completed games**: Which picks were obvious vs surprising upsets
- **For upcoming games**: Which picks have strong data support vs weak signals

## Accessing the Summary

Click the **"Week Summary"** button in the header to open the weekly summary modal for the currently selected week.

## Summary Structure

The summary is divided into two main tabs:

### 1. Upcoming Games Tab

Shows games that haven't been played yet, organized by confidence level.

#### High Confidence Picks 🎯
**"Strong data supporting these picks"**

These games have:
- **Confidence Score**: 70-100%
- **Strong metric alignment**: Most metrics support the same pick
- **Clear indicators**: Large statistical advantages

**What this means**: The data strongly supports picking one team. These are your most reliable picks where metrics align.

**Example**: Team A is favored by 7 points, and they have:
- Better ATS record (65% vs 40%)
- Higher point differential (+8 vs -3)
- Better recent form (2-1 ATS last 3 vs 0-3)
- All 7 metrics point to Team A covering

#### Moderate Confidence ⚖️
**"Some metrics support, some don't"**

These games have:
- **Confidence Score**: 50-69%
- **Mixed signals**: Some metrics support the favorite, others don't
- **Moderate advantages**: Differences exist but aren't overwhelming

**What this means**: The data leans one way but isn't conclusive. These picks require more careful analysis or gut feel.

**Example**: Team A favored by 3, but:
- Better overall ATS (55% vs 48%) ✓
- Worse recent form (1-2 vs 2-1) ✗
- Similar point differentials
- 5 of 8 metrics support Team A

#### Low Confidence ⚠️
**"Weak or conflicting signals - proceed with caution"**

These games have:
- **Confidence Score**: 0-49%
- **Conflicting data**: Metrics don't agree on a pick
- **Small differences**: Teams are statistically similar
- **Underdog favored**: Sometimes metrics actually favor the underdog over the spread favorite

**What this means**: The data doesn't provide clear guidance. These are toss-ups or potential upset opportunities.

**Example**: Team A favored by 6, but:
- Worse ATS as favorite (40% vs underdog's 60% as dog)
- Worse recent form
- Only 3 of 8 metrics support the favorite
- Consider the underdog

### 2. Completed Games Tab

Shows games that have finished, categorized by how predictable they were.

#### Could Have Easily Had That One ✓
**"Metrics strongly supported the winning pick"**

These games are classified as "easy picks" when:
- **70%+ of metrics** supported the winner
- **High average importance scores** (50+)
- The data clearly pointed to the correct pick

**What this means**: If you had followed the metrics, you would have made the right pick. These validate your analytical approach.

**Use this for**:
- Building confidence in your metrics
- Identifying which stats were most predictive
- Recognizing patterns for similar future matchups

**Example**:
- Team A covered the -5.5 spread
- 8 out of 10 metrics favored Team A
- Average importance score: 65/100
- **Lesson**: The data was there - trust it next time!

#### Nobody Saw That Coming ⚡
**"Metrics didn't support the outcome - pure upsets"**

These games are classified as "upsets" when:
- **40% or fewer metrics** supported the winner
- Data pointed strongly to the other team
- The result defied statistical expectations

**What this means**: Even the best analysis can't predict everything. These are outlier games where flukes, injuries, or intangibles dominated.

**Use this for**:
- Understanding when to accept unpredictability
- Not overthinking future similar situations
- Recognizing truly random outcomes

**Example**:
- Underdog Team B won outright as +7 dogs
- Only 3 out of 10 metrics supported Team B
- Average importance score: 28/100
- **Lesson**: Sometimes flukes happen - don't chase patterns that aren't there

#### Toss-Ups ~
**"Mixed signals - could have gone either way"**

These games fall in between:
- **41-69% metrics** supported the winner
- Moderate importance scores
- Genuinely competitive matchups

**What this means**: The game was as close as the data suggested. No clear edge either way.

**Use this for**:
- Identifying games to avoid or go with gut feel
- Recognizing when to look for other factors (weather, motivation, etc.)

## Understanding the Cards

### Upcoming Game Cards
Each upcoming game card shows:
- **Matchup**: Away @ Home teams
- **Spread**: Which team is favored and by how much
- **Confidence Bar**: Visual representation of data strength (0-100%)
- **Suggested Pick**: Which team the metrics support (if clear)
- **Pick Reason**: Why that team is suggested
- **Metric Badges**: How many metrics support (✓) vs oppose (✗) the pick

### Completed Game Cards
Each completed game card shows:
- **Result**: Winner and loser with scores
- **Metric Support**: How many metrics predicted the winner
- **Average Importance**: How strong those supporting metrics were (0-100)
- **Category Badge**: Easy Pick / Upset / Toss-Up classification
- **Click Hint**: Reminder that you can click to see full backtest

## How to Use This Effectively

### For Upcoming Games

1. **Start with High Confidence**
   - These are your safest picks
   - Use them as anchors for parlays
   - Trust the data - don't overthink

2. **Be Careful with Low Confidence**
   - Consider skipping these games
   - Look for additional context (injuries, weather, line movement)
   - Sometimes the underdog is the better pick

3. **Review Metric Alignment**
   - Look for games where ALL metrics agree
   - Be wary when only 1-2 metrics support a pick

### For Completed Games

1. **Review "Easy Picks" You Missed**
   - Click to see the full backtest
   - Identify which metrics you should have weighted more heavily
   - Build confidence in your process

2. **Don't Overanalyze Upsets**
   - Accept that some games are unpredictable
   - Don't try to find patterns in chaos
   - Move on - variance is part of sports

3. **Study Toss-Ups**
   - These reveal the limits of statistical prediction
   - Look for non-statistical factors that might help
   - Consider avoiding similar games in the future

## Importance Score Breakdown

The importance score (0-100) combines:

1. **Difference Strength** (Base Score)
   - How much better one team's metric was
   - Larger differences = higher base scores

2. **Prediction Accuracy** (Multiplier)
   - Metrics that correctly predicted get 1.5x boost
   - Incorrect predictions don't get the boost

### Score Ranges
- **70-100**: Strong, reliable indicator
  - Large statistical advantage + predicted correctly
  - Trust this metric heavily

- **40-69**: Moderate signal
  - Noticeable difference between teams
  - Helpful but not definitive

- **0-39**: Weak signal
  - Small difference OR predicted incorrectly
  - Don't weight this heavily

## Weekly Workflow

### Before Games Start
1. Open Weekly Summary
2. Identify High Confidence games for your picks
3. Research Low Confidence games for context
4. Make your selections

### After Games Complete
1. Review completed games by category
2. Click "Easy Picks" you got right → reinforce what worked
3. Click "Easy Picks" you missed → learn what you overlooked
4. Click "Upsets" → accept variance, don't overthink
5. Adjust your approach for next week

## Pro Tips

### Patterns to Look For

**Across Multiple Weeks:**
- Are certain metrics consistently in the "high importance" range?
- Do favorites or underdogs tend to perform better?
- Are home/away splits meaningful in your league?

**Within a Week:**
- If multiple games show low confidence, the week might have more variance
- Weeks with many high-confidence games = more predictable outcomes
- Mix of confidence levels = normal variance

### When Metrics Disagree

If you see conflicting signals:
1. **Check recent form** - teams change throughout the season
2. **Look at context** - injuries, weather, rest days
3. **Weight spread-specific metrics higher** - ATS% matters more than raw points
4. **Consider the line** - sometimes a 3-point spread should be a 10-point spread

### Building Your Strategy

Use the summary to develop a personal approach:
- Some weeks, only bet high-confidence games
- Some weeks, look for low-confidence underdogs as upsets
- Track your success rate by confidence level
- Adjust based on what YOUR results show

## Technical Notes

### Data Freshness
